###Zero-Shot Image Captioning
üìã Project Overview
This project enables zero-shot image captioning, allowing users to generate captions for images in languages they choose, even for images the model has never seen before. It leverages Hugging Face Transformers, CLIP, and BERT models to provide versatile and language-independent captions.

üöÄ Key Features
Zero-Shot Captioning:

Generates captions for unseen images without prior training on them.
Multilingual Support:

Users can specify captions in any desired language or provide example sentences for guidance.
Easy-to-Use:

Designed for people worldwide, with no language restrictions or barriers.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python
Hugging Face Transformers
CLIP Model
BERT Model
üí° How It Works
Upload an Image:

Provide an input image that needs to be captioned.
Specify Language/Sentence:

Choose the desired language or provide a reference sentence.
Generate Caption:

The system generates a descriptive caption for the input image in the specified language.
